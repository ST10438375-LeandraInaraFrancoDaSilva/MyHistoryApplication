and get information on people that left a big message to this world and are no longer here. 
This historical figures are 10 and their ages vary inside of the mentioned range, all this 
information is stored into a list that is present in the code behind the app which allows 
this comparisons to be made.

the same age as the figure that died in that age is displayed and looking for a way to still 
link people to the figures even though their not the same age there is a 3 year gap condition 
on the code that generates messages on the user being 3 years older or younger than the person 
in the list. In case of ages outside of the stipulated range or in gaps longer than 3 years a 
message of no figures found is displayed so that the user reenters the data following the criterias.
